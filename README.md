# Prepare the environment

For the test/bootcamp environment, an OCI conform container-tool is required. 
Furthermore, you need to be able to execute `docker-compose` files.
There are several options to run a `docker-compose`-file:

- Docker Compose: [More](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Podman Compose: [More](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose)

If these requirements are fulfilled, you can start the environment 
depending on your OS and OCI-tool.

For Linux and macOS:

- Docker: `./start_environment_docker.sh`
- Podman: `./start_environment_podman.sh` 

For Windows: 

- Docker: `./start_environment_docker.bat` 
- Podman: `./start_environment_podman.bat`
